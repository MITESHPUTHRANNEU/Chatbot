it was not like the real imdband generated tablaeu reports for the same yeah i was uploading my projects in githubi am not sure about using imdb because they may think it's the whole website maybe say something like a sample databaseokor you can say movie website and in paranthases sinilar to imdb👍🏼 nice input btw not working todaythey are not in drive i was trying to find itits there in my drivewe

bust95 percent of data in these files are excel generated false datayesssss happy st patrick's day 🍻haha thanks you toohey girl my friend has a data science project where he has to find out the combination of numbers which has the highest probability​ of winning in a lottery so i wanted to ask you how does this lottery work do we get a chance to select the number combination we want or just take ticket and scratch it to reveal the numbersdepends on the lottery powerball you select numbers scratch ticket is nothing you can do you scratch it and pray it works hahahaha oki think the lottery website had the previous numbers and how many times they selected you can see what numbers usually appear the mosthe has to write an algorithm to predict the future results it will not be the exact number but somewhere close to itif he wants to get data about the previous numbers he can look st the website because some numbers are chosen multiple times while others maybe once or noneok will let

interest like that put the classes or what you want to work at my adviser said for the projects do mostly result oriented and for specific jobs you can change the skills and interest part depending on the job description he told me include things like created over 5 stored procedures and the project duration like in one month created this or thatohh ok that makes senseand say stuff like performance increase this much or that muchwell in our case we don't have such thingsthen it should be finelike performance improvement or got better results etcbecause you already talked about the software you usehmm yeahmaybe you can say for the user interface you have multiples of it right for each type of person logging in each see something else maybe say it supports this many people or this many rolesyesbut i think mostly your project descriptions seems good to meok thank you for your timei didn't even do anything shut uphahahaand my friend told me to show your resume to a person working in that field if you find anyone like that because mostly recruitment people don't know any technical shit to understand anythingyeah i am trying to show it to many people as much as i canschool only check for the typos and the layout they do t really know betteryeahwas shocked the most when i saw technical recruiters of many companies don't even have a technical backgroundi have seen them with experience as a baristano they are only hr peoplewtfthey do the first cut or the generic stuff so even if you explain they won't get youno they are technical recruiter who recruit for technical roles

registering for next yeari was looking but you need to qualify i thinkwe can't qualify directly as we need official time so we can do one thingmaybe through charitieswe need to register with the organization that is taking part yeah i am gonna do it when registration opensdo you know how it works do you run the whole thing or some part of itthere is one 5k run which is shorter but i want to run the 26mile one do let me know if when you are registeringcan you do that if you register through charitiesyes we can i was reading about it few days backso you just pick what you want to do yeah i looked online too but still wasn't surei am not sure about whether you have the option to choose it i always wanted to do ityeah today was so good i felt like i must do it tooyeah i have strong feeling that i have to go for the next yearyeah let me know too i don't know when it will be open for next yearyes for sureen you let me know if you get any info about itkeep checking their websiteyeah it would be so much fun even very old people were runningyeslove running bcoz it makes you feel relievedage is no limithe lift her up at the endcoolit was so coolthis makes me to take part next year moreyeah let's do it👍🏼 definitely promise👍<media omitted> dafaq is thiscool so septemberyes it is but did you see the details properly it says 2016 sep but i saw one site it says it will be in september 2017yeah it should be around the same timehttps://registrationbaaorg/2017/cf/regathlete/webappcfmmode=closed&snap=41748572& their main website is down right now so can't see the details required <media omitted>registration opens couple of months ago i thinktell me when you registeren i don't need to rememberhaha🤡👽 girl http://wwwbaaorg/races/boston-marathon/participant-information/athlete-registrationaspx have a look at this and i was reading about the charity groupsselected candidates will then have to pledge a fundraiser of minimum $5000 😕this is the process of every charity http://wwwrunnersworldcom/boston-marathon/2018-boston-marathon-registration-faq seethe last question and its answer do you know someone vip hahai am vip myself 😹 i was thinking about running a smaller one first to see if i could do it like 10keven i thought about iten that has the same procedurei know you are a vipno you can run 10k i think there was one on baa's website it didn't say anything about qualifyingare you suresaw in the registration page where we had to fill in the qualifying timeconfirm it and let me knowok will look when i am home🤘🏼<media omitted> look at additional info it does t need qualifiers it's 65 dollarsclick on the registration link <media omitted> it also says projected timei think you can write anything they don't want prof proof even a 13 year old can registeryou try it first then tell me if you were able to go ahead 😝or we can send an email and askyesi know 5k everybody does itohh cool tell me then when you are registeringthat 10k is in june we need to train for it you know right it's not like let's go runyes that's why i was thinking of the full marathoni heard boston marathon is little difficult and ask for qualifiers the others now because istanbul marathon everyone can joinohhif you want boston marathon you have to run a different marathon in 3 something hours then register and pray you get accepted because i don't think i can raise any money and you have to raise 5000hahait's not happeningeven half marathon requires charity or qualifying timei was watching something the other day a girl does la marathon with 10 weeks of training and she says she doesn't run so some marathons don't need time i guesscoolyeah i ll look more into it too it was on youtube you can watch it toooki don't know we have to do researchhalf marathon is not possible and then there is mayor's cup have to look into itdamn it's cold outsideis it you are a vip so take a helicopter

todayhahahe is extremely goofy thoughtell me one weird thing about youi am 90% weird didn't you noticeyou are not weird you are crazyyeah that too i look very unapproachable for example everyone is

as strong as i canbtw are you still doing the udemyand summer is the only chance i get to do it other semesters i have to take course yeah that udemy oneyeah i agree with you don't take classes during summer use that time to learn and do projectsyeahotherwise you will end up jobless like me hahayou don't saythat udemy class don't have so much info on statistics i looked at it todayohhdon't you think sobut you know statistics very well righti am ok not experti have no experience with stats whatever i did was in high school levelyou know in data mining there are stuff like k- nearest neighbor categorization blah blah naive bates i didn't see stuff there but maybe i didn't look at the modeling sectionohh okor is that machine learningyou doing the levels randomly or in orderi was watching them when i am on the train so since i can't practice tableu on the train i looked at the section twosupervised and unsupervised learning etc come under machine learning okstarts with stats refreshlol you study in 🚆 damnnot really i looked at it today hey you still in school how do you do projects thoughnopekaggleyou can use datasets from various sourceswrong windowlol multitaskingalways sucks i know it from experience haha😂 why are the syntaxes in r not straight forward unnecessarily making in confusing😂 is t worse than phytonnope python is straight forward making it very easyr is little weird i knowr is not difficult like java and stuff but why make it confusing <media omitted>what is thatyour mining course what you doingi am home it's raining again todayyeah subtle rain is good with little warm weatheryeah when it's too hot it's not goodyeah did you do any mining project in thisyeah i did didn't i send you my homeworks and projectsyeah you sent there's no project in thatoh it might be on my desktop will check it when i am homeok sure just wanted to ask what did you do in thatit was bout predicting flight delays logistic regression and stuff it wasn't too great but i will send youohh wow sounds good oki got small sample of data available online did the processing on excel though because i didn't have time at that timeok hey evajoymay allah always guide you all throughout your journey in life i wish this ramadan will infuse you with courage that will help you be triumphant over the adversities of life happy ramadanthank you :)so what exactly is this month all about are you gonna fast everydayno not really it's difficult in the summerhaha but its easy for you because you don't eat anything anywaysthe problem is you have to finish eating at 330 am night then i have to go to work fast break is around 8 at nightohhh its difficulthow am i supposed to sleep and go to work then workoutit disrupts the cycleyou can't sleep that's the problemyeahso i might do on my days offohh good <media omitted> <media omitted>beautifulhey tell me one thingone thing 😜wow so intelligent the first module in data mining contains stats etc do we need to learn it side by side or is it covered in the coursei know he doesn't teach stats really you are expected to know i guessok coolhe goes over what it was roughlyi dropped sherman's classcongrats hahadoing this and that data science course this summer hahayeah good idea i was looking at an edx course today statistical thinking for data analytics and data sciencenice which one superbit's very good if you need statisticsthat goes well with your profilesimple languagewill look into it thenit's from columbia i think it might work if you are not good at statisticsohh is it the one where you said you had to pay $300 for certificateno this one different you don't have to pay you can watch the classes without payingokif you want a certificicate they want 99 but i was just looking at it brieflyi don't need certificateyeah it's good for info with statistics i need simple language👍🏼i am so nice 😜yeah you are😂 but seriously thank youhahah just kidding i didn't do anything you tell me all the time too about classesthat's fine that edx course you suggested wasn't really i was looking for i found a pdf online which teaches you stats as well as shows ways to implement it in python http://greenteapresscom/thinkstats2/thinkstats2pdfoh ok goodhttps://wwwanalyticsvidhyacom/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-r-data-science/ https://wwwanalyticsvidhyacom/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/omg that's so coool explains everythingyeah step by step guide to go on data mining is 5th or 6th stepat's why i wasn't understanding the stats wellfrom your courseyeah my course was crazy when i start it i didn't understand a shithahathen later i looked at stuff and it made sensethat's the case with me i understood the markdown etc but from lesson 2 onwards this stats escalated too quicklyso what are you doing now udemy class and these tutorialsyeah i will go ahead with udemy first then when i finish the stats from udemy i will proceed in parallel with your data mining course and also do stuff from the link i posted above because those things need to go hand in handhow many internships did you apply for summer80+ probablydamn did you hear backfrom many some didn't reply backdid you do interviewsmany were rejects nope i just need one chance for the interview i won't let it go recently one contacted me they said they want to talk to me i replied back with my phone number but they didn't call backi keep applying and applying and totals to 30 how long did you take you to apply 80it's probably around 100 i have been applying since februarydid anyone contact you from linkedinthey don't contact you from linkedin but recruiters view your profile some contacted me randomly though like they have certain position would i be interesteddid you write a cover letter for every positionyes wherever they had a option to i have a generic cover letter where i tweak a portion of it for different companiesi am so depressed i think i ll be jobless foreverwhat happenednobody wants mehey don't talk like that😵wtf you just have to push forward it's not gonna be easysince i graduated i feel like it's harderwhat has that gotta do with itor maybe not hireable not smart like the rest of the people applying there are so many people with mastersthere are jobs too you have a very good gpa showcase ithow other than applying most people do not even look at your applicationyou need to have a good resume with the buzz words your resume is first checked by bots if it makes through it goes to the hr linkedin is a great platform where when you search for jobs and apply to them some of them have a section where it showcases who posted this job you can contact that person directly and explain them how you are the right fit have you used the premium account of linkedin if not there is free one month access which gives you the chance to directly connect and message the hr or other relevant peopledid you contact them what do you sayi contacted few because many have the in mail feature which is only accessible by premium account i told them how i have taken the particular course and how it helps me to understand the concept which i would be using in my projects etc not everyone i send the msg responds back some are kind enough to let me know what they are looking for it's a constant process tell them how your statistics combined with programming knowledge is perfect for the position how you could use your previous academic experience for it etcok thanks i ll try👍🏼have you seen any jobs at nu careersyup i haveis that workingthe last person who contacted me was from one of the jobs i applied at nucareeri tried to access that but couldn'twhat does the portal sayit said error kept bringing that login page maybe my cookies can you access it nowwait let me checkbtw am i bothering you you don't have to replynot at all why would

semesteronly a part of it is gonna help mefor the tableaubecause the dwbi course is aimed at data engineers who do all the processing of data before it's given to the data analyst/data scientist for analysis the course will prepare you to be a data engineeryou know more than me hahahhaha i am boredthere was a lampoon building at harvard so cutei have no idea what that isthere is google hahahlol

then there was a crazy dude in quincy market <media omitted> <media omitted>ha funny i did the video thing now it was so weirdhaha it's always wierd when we gilm ourselves filmoh god i don't even take pics of myself😂😂 how was your experience when you saw yourself in the videoit was timed too 3 mins wasn't enough i got panicked a little bit when time was runnning outohh 3 min is less you weren't aware that it was for 3mini was but they asked 3 questions at a time like why do you want to work here your strength why you are the best fit all at the same time 3 minsohgive details of a project what was the challenging ting you had with a team mate how did you resolve what was your strategy all at the same fucking timedafaqyeah how am i supposed to give details in that caseyeah i wouldn't have remembered the first few questions did you answer all of themi couldn't give to much details so time was running out i got panicked little bitthat's fine even they know that would happen what did you say to what issues you faced in your projectthere was a math question i did that in 3 secs hahahahaholari thought you would say two indians are disastrous to work with 😂yeah i said miteshthank you i feel honored😜of course you are famousi know ppl can't handle memitesh hopefully i didn't screw upno dear you didn'tbut one way video is really weird i prefer phonemany companies have itit's better at least when you get stuck the other person talks most companies do videoyeah as their first interview rounddamn i ll die hungry 😂hahai thought most companies do phoneyeah that too even google has its first round as a video interview but at least it's two way communication rather than throwing all the questions at you onceyeah that's better at least you have enough timeenough time for whatto explainyeahyour answer and a reaction from other person this was so lonelyhahai looked like a lunatic who talks to the ghostshow was the person in front reacting to your answerswhorishino you didn't get it it's a one way no other person you read the question and time starts 3 min endsohh fuck ok that's insanelking to yourselfwhat a shitty way in 2017 to do thisand see yourself in he camera and time runs out😂and you are like fuuuccckkkkhahai don't know an american would do better than me for sure at least for them it's their native languageyou are an americanthey can talk too fast and say everything in 3 mins but it's more difficult for me to be that fastit doesn't matter they would consider that as many international people apply tooyeah anyways i can't do anything about it now if they call they call i did a test too on paper for this i probably scored very high in that math questions mostlythat's very nice girl i am sure about you cracking it very easilymaybe 50% chanceyou are good at it they will surely look that and always do analysis on how you did in your interview it would help you to know your strengths and weaknessanyways sorry for giving you a headachewtf girl what are for why you feel like thatyou always ask am i disturbing you so i should ask toothat's just a formal thing but now i won't ask youomg how dare youyes i will what are you doingwatching series nowwhich oneit's an old one i never finished it now i am finishing fringeturkishno americanokit's little bit science fiction it's called fringeohh then i need to watch it i love scifithere are alternative universe and stuffwow did you see stranger thingsunnatural stuff happening fbi has a division for itniceyou can probably find it online it played 5 seasonsyeah i will see it the first episode's starting part is so horrifying aeroplane one damn i am already addicted but it's cringy kind of scifihahah seriously i thought you would make fun of me because i like itwhy would i make fun of you everyone has different tastesome stuff is difficult to believelol its addictivei like that it is in boston and sci fi but more realistic conceptyeah even i was surprisedit's not like super man with flying powershahaand i like detective stuffit would be very possible in the near future and boston is a medical hubi said you would make fun because it's an old one so it's not filmed so modernfbi agent eva kocyigit👮🏻‍♀if they filmed now maybe it would be more believable with the new effects even mom ioves it hahahahadr bishop is funnyhell yeah he iswith the cow lolhe got a god damn cow in his lab hahathat cow is so cute🐮with the pink noisehaha the best part was when they were taking the cow to lab along side the classrooms mooooooahh ahah i wish that happened in our school everything was so normal unfortunatelyhaha imagine you are in sherman's class and a cow goes from outsidehahah i wishit won't have such impact as it had in the seriesi would die laughing😂😂imagine sherman and his reaction he would get milk for his coffee hangshaha he would get fresh milk for his starbucks haha we guessed the same thinghahah imagine him milking the cow talking about relational databaseshaha and it kicking him on the face he would be likehahaha he would actually die cows are strongohh i knowi still don't understand why he has a cow in the lab though just for the milk i guess he is always milking the cowhahahabut he doesn't do any experiments on himhaha trueanyways i am going to sleep have fun with bishop 😂haha ok good night sleep tightlike what i have been watching it last monthohh then you are naturally like that😝i am watching it turkish voiceover not in englishlol whymom watches it too it's easierohh okwhat do i usei will let you know soon have a nice sleep💤💤💤💤💤💤haha ok but make a note i am curioussure💤💤the episodes keep on getting intensedid you sleep at allof courseept after 2nd episodewoke up an hr backahah i left you watching it and it was as if you never stoppedhaha but i am hookedit's nothing yet gets crazierohh godthey are so creativeeither my whole summer would go watching this or i will complete this in one week and do nothing else😝but i think some of the stuff are actually theories later on there are alternative universe and stuff and really in science some people believe there is onethere might be even i think to some levelimagine there is another me oh god the world cannot take that😂😂😂 you being crazy in all of themin other ones maybe crazier than this maybe this version is the most sane onethen good help them god😂😂everything i suspected in the second episode came true in the third onenums lover is not dead woman from massive dynamics knows everything and using danum for something homeland security guy is linked with the ladydamn this series is good for data analytics😝hahahah you crazyhahadid you formulate the whole thingthat's what data scientist do😂what episode are you oni just finished 3 episodes and there is 5 seasons areyeah i am on season 3never try to understand the concepts in depth discussed in the show i am already going crazy like bishop save me and one thing i am very skeptic about is it all a test where the lady from massive dynamics is just testing danhums ability because she wants to hire her into the company otherwise they would have easily killed her if she was interfering with their workno they need her actually later on they are all on the same side it looks like massive dynamic is responsible for everything but notok don't tell me the plot buy haha the suspense is killing me hahahaday the most awkward thing took placewe went to the alpha management's office today to renew our lease for next year the person sitting in the office told me the manager would like to speak with us first i said oken the person who came out is the same person who came for the inspectionhahahawho said he was a policehe wasn't the police he came along with the boston pd personnelen after some discussion i told him there will be 5 personsso he said the rent would be $2500 then i started laughing why they fuck i will pay that much to love in a shit hole like that i told him if he he going to give for $2350 i would still consider he said no so i am moving out after august now i have to search for a apartmentomg but you have time start looking now i hate apartment searchingactually i have a apartment in sight my friend's senior friends have got full time and are moving out so we could get that apartment it's a 3bhk in mission main apartments's very spacious and they don't have issues of checkingdo you know any place which is a good option and not expensivethat's sounds good how about the apartments that ta girl was livinghahaha you want me to live with her

everything and he has a major role to whatever that's happened so farr you gonna finish it stillyeswow dedication i am so impressed 😜<media omitted>they made a mistake there right i don't know how that happened he never appears againhttps://scifistackexchangecom/questions/7213/why-did-charlie-francis-appear-in-the-episode-11-of-season-2-of-fringe it happens that it's a episode of season one which was never aired so they randomly placed it in season 2 the link has the explanation i love the fact how walter argues with the pastor on science and religionhaha it's funny they even discuss that onlinehaha yeah people are crazy about this like methis is an old show thoughyeahere is a whole website which discusses scifiand it's like stack overflowi saw it from the linkhaha that means we are normalare we or are we all crazyhmmmis gets me thinkingwe are crazy about these things others have different interest so how can you compare them in craziness scaleyeah we re definitely less crazy than the people who go to comic conventions where they dress up like cartoon charactershaha one of my roommate is into those cosplay caractersomg where do you live you need to get out of that house before it's too latehahan't worry i won't turn crazy living with himas it is he sat in the other room staysit might be infectioushahaen if you see something wrong in me help meor take me to walteri wouldn't really bother hahah i would have to give up on yougo and die 😝i heard about this it was on boston calendaryeahdisgustingi thought of telling you this then i was like 😝yeah i didn't tell you this i told someone it's just nasty and most of them are booked fullyhahaback by popular demand it was saying on the advertisementhahaimagine they ask where did you meet at naked yogahaha such an embarrassing story imagine if their kids as them somedayahah that first moment i see her naked i was in love or something oh disgusting😂😂 but then it's still not that embarrassing it's the humans bodyyeah think about he yoga positionsi say this because i had taken biology so it doesn't make me haha i imagine the person behindbent forward and look upwho has to see all thisnot that interested really😂😂probably room smells too as it gets hotterohh please don't talk about thatand some transgender people might be therehaha but you won't sweat bcoz you aren't wearing anything 😜and it so funny how in the picture every one is a girl it's like saying come to see naked girlshahaha live porn and nobody cares about itit's terrible so wrong look at their websiteohh i had seen itthey make it sound like they are doing something good we accept everyone blah blah kinda bullshitwelcome to americagive people a space where they can practice naked without judgment i was like wtf why is that a necessity to begin withthey can better do it in their home theni wouldn't even work out naked home by myself😂 actually we should do a project on the stupidity levels of american we can come up with wonderful analysisthey just don't do what else to do have so much free time on their hands nothing to worry about yeah imagine we use that for the interviewsall americans are not like that but most of them don't worry about their life at all yea we can showcase our skillsthat would be the funniest thing everthere was one question in while i was filling the intern position in the companies website it asked me what are the 10 things that can be explained in the map rather than an excel sheet i started giving out answers likenkin stores in bostontraffic hrsd roads in bostonthere were many puns i wrote in that enjoyed it haha i have it see this <media omitted>did you say the stupidity of the statesthey asked me the inconsistencies that cannot be explained in text format something like thatbtw i have a phone interview with new balance next fridaywould congratulations that greatno it's first screening but it's a one year position like a coopok if you are interested go ahead it will help youi don't know i have learn more it says database management and analysis togetherohh database management is hardcore backendabout their materials i thinkwhat's the profile descriptionit doesn't say much but they sql and stuff so that's what i understand information systems somethingif it's basic then you can easily do iti don't even remember applying but i gues i did😂hahah maybe i applied as an internship position to pass the summer but they say it's one yearlike a contract typei don't know if they can offer a full time at the end of it it doesn't say contract it says intern i guess a long coop maybethen definitely internship yeah do your sql stuffi don't know if i get it and if nothing comes along other than this i might to get more experienceyeahke itit will definitely help youbut what if you take it and something else happens like a normal jobyou can terminate it why do you care you are an american😂hahah yeahi would feel at homeit should be the same for everyone right can i terminate howlol you are not in the school anymorebut what if you sign somethingyou can say to your employer that you have a full time offer in hand if they have some kind of bond then you might need to pay upyeah i seeor else they might make you work more in your leaving period to get the most out of youi am gonna do the thing and think about those if i get an offer henyeah see as it is this is one year internship it not going to go on forever so if you get a full time offer you know what call you have to makeyeah i still don't know what are the conditions actually i don't know anything about ithahabecause i got an offer when i left my other coop but i didn't like thatthey will have details like you applied to this positionit does but little ambiguousif you didn't like that then what's the point in pursuing itno that's why i didn't take it but there is a chance if i do the internship they might offer full time here toothen ask them during the phone interview get the details like what kind of work you would be doing whether they would convert into full time and i think they will convert it as one year is a long timeyeah of course i will are you going tot he pride

think a marriage will last foreverif you are ready to compromise little it can last foreveryou are just naivelook at our parentsmarriages don't last because of love etc they last mostly women don't have any place to go so they put up with all the shit men do for that reason in modern life they don't last because men mostly cheat and do stupid shitohh goddivorce is eventual so why not get

their wealth to be given away hahano not about wealth but about marriages don't last kinda stuff and why you should t make kids they are so shocked if i open my mouth so i keep it closehaha there is lot of populationbut the problem is most people in the world get married or have kids not because they think about it or make he decision mostly they think it's what they should do in life but they don't know the reason it's not a well thought decisionhaha yeahthat's why they are miserable and they will be miserable when you say i don't want kids they go crazybeing parents is a big dealthey say you have to have a kid then you ask why no good reason they give it's because you have to gave kids or get married or you will die alone😂😂you can have kids and be married and still die alone everybody is alone even if you are marriedyou know even i thinkl you earn should be used to live a great life by yourselfextra can be given to the charityi rather die alone than living miserably with a

she finally met the guy she always wanted in her life he was super workoholic he was so busy in his work he never got the time to go out with someone and was wondering would he ever get married so once the guy went to the bar on the weekend even though he had so much work left to be done he was so frustrated that he went on drinking and was so drunk he couldn't handle himself well and surprisingly the girl was also present in the bar she was so worried for him that she started talking to him eventually the man opened up how distressed he was in his life and wanted to change from his normal behavior she came to know a lot about him and eventually they fell in love and decided to get married after marriage the workload started increasing and couldn't find free time to spend with his wife but he gave her all his credit cards so that she could love happily somedays the husband wouldn't even come home from work eventually months passed by and husband forgot that he had a

we can use the same or similar methods so we make sure that we understand and know these things and move on the next type of machine learningyeah i agree with you but deciding on a dataset is our choiceonce we are comfortable with basic stuff move on the more intermediate and all oh god puthran there will be a lot of decision making when it comes to datasetsyeah okdid you already finish thisi am sorry if i am being a dick's just that i want to have a clear path of progress😅yeahother tutorials use the similar methodsi have not checked them yetcheck them if yes move onto thosei will let you

you hahahayeah right you suck 😡hahahah now i am having fun so did you see any mongo nosql is it terrible any exposurehahahat yet mongo for me right now is not that importantit's simpler than reqular relational database that's what i heard not very much familiar myselfthey were talking about it at work so i was not sure if i saw it or not that's why i asked is it easier to code is that what you heardhahahai am noti am not sure about it i know that it's columnar than the regular relational one so data is not stored in rows rather column wiseoki sorry i went to a meetingthat's fine did you ask your manager about itno fernando told me they have the whole thing in mongo too if you want to use thatohhhe said they have it available but no one knows how to use itohh lolexcept it for reporting people no one knows i meanok got itanyways i always mix those upyou carry onso that's why i asked you how is the difficult class goingthat's fineu can ask me anything anytimeit's goodomg so coolyeah it's goodyou are the cool kid nowi love knowing things and learning about them so you might find me boring but that's who i ami am surprised you still talk to regular people like me cool kidi love talking to youeven from me omg 😂 majesty it's my honor to teach you somethingohh trust me i have learnt many things from you not necessarily about study but so many other things alsolikedealing with americanswow now i need to learn those from youi mean you used to give your everything in the db class to learn i wouldn't have done that much back in indiai do it only if i like the stuff not alwaysthat's the reason why i find it easier to deal with complex courses which i love you the best eveeewe are not average at allyeaht we have to be better than ourselvesfor me learning is a life long process i don't compare myself with anyone i just want to be a better version of myselfit has to be you have to be updating yourself and keeping up with the recent stuffyesssotherwise you become useless knowledge is power honeyyes that's what i am saying you carry onok talk later show me is you see something interesting in classesyes for sure i will show you this one i talked about when i finishyeah sounds funthis is an interesting article have a look

i ll read in depth when i get home keep them coming puthran hahaoklists the various skill sets required by employers in usafor data sciencegood keep me updated darling don't keep the info to yourself 😂same applies to you girlllllputhran what happened to your picwhich onewhat's appit's there i don't see anything differenti don't see itohh why let me see do you see itdid you remove me from your contacts😂lol why would i see this <media omitted>that's the pic i sent youi think there is some issue in the settingsyes ok i see it not the picture anyways what am i sayingsay eveee lolit's too early i am losing it alreadyhahao much information overloadyou know i was talking about the tumor data i was analyzing's was not the image data but numeric datawe are doing another one which is image data where we identify the numbers from the images the numbers are not printed fonts instead the are handwritings so we write a algorithm the identity numbers from handwritingsomg sounds coolyeah you carry oni ll text you latersurei see it nowhmmm i changed itis columbus day a holiday at school coming up you know you would at the library anywayshey it would be a holidayahhhahahi don't have class as it is why you laughingnothing i was messing with youbtw the tutorial i was talking in the morningwhat tutorial where is itthe handwriting recognition one https://apsportalibmcom/exchange/public/entry/view/efb51900cc9d687fb9f05b2eabb66cb5you didn't send it though before rightnopeis is of the cognitive classwe are currently using ibm datascince experiencehow am i gonna save this shithahahahacan you send me an email instead with the linkyou code this in jupyter notebookthank you mitesh you are the best hahahaok i will send you specially just for you or else i chage $50i am such an asshoel todayhaha whydon't know maybe ya fridayhahahanot really i will be finishing this class which i doubt i can it it's supposed to be nice this

so what's this python course ondata analysis in phytonok did you get it <media omitted> are the customers bothering you today hahahahahah happens to me all the time without the phone partyeah right the handwriting model made me sleep from breaking my head it's gone crazy and predicting crap <media omitted> hahahahaha that's funhey eveeewhat's up mayteshdon't even ask 😪 i am crying from insideyou ask for it darlingi wish there was someone to study this with it's never endingaww i would study with youhaha you would you don't even have time to do other things how would you do thisif i was taking

students as long as they bring money to school and publish nobody questions themi am doing my cognitive shit yeah seriouslythat's how it isnowadays i am stuck at home instead of the libraryno indians like rishi😂there are indians 6 of them 2 chinese and 1 americanyeah so make a friendthis american sits with me always but he doesn't know shit about this course i hope he doesn't become my partner if group is madehahha because he is americanhahahahaher indians 3 of them are learning python now and other 2 i talk but they are in the same position as meso it's like basically everyone is in a deep shit right nowform your group now before you get screwedthe thing is the professor is not sure whether he is gonna make grps as there are only 9 of them this course was taken just once before in the spring this is so advanced that it's not a regular course for us it's a special topic the only thing that is helping me out a lot is the udemy machine learning course as it covers the basic topics wellyes go mitesh you can do ityesneed that boostsleepless nights would all be worth itof course knowledge is power everywhere every timeyeah hey eveee remember the titanic dataset problem we didhahah funnyi know i am not supposed to message you at night but i hope i get an exception for this oney you have the best of the health all your wishes come true and you get whatever you dream of have a

i̇ hope you like the shoes tooyes i liked iti̇ ll text you tomorrow sometime good nightsure will be waiting😂hahah ok sweet dreamshey dear did you try out the mouse if you experience some issues like it turning off because your computer puts the bluetooth devices to sleep when not used for long then follow these steps 1 open the device managercouldn't get it work last night i am trying nowohh ok does it have all the instructionsi turned on the bluetoothyou basically do the same thing like you add a new bluetooth device to the laptopand press add a device and it's trying to find i guessyes you need to press the bluetooth button on the mouseyes it says unknown device on laptop and i press connectthenyes i̇t worked omg so coolgreat if you experience some problems with the pointer just follow the above stepsthis is really great i̇ did those alreadyyo my smart eveeethanks maytesh haha so smart i̇ can't handle 😂😂it says the battery in this mouse goes for 24 months that's coolyeahpends on your usagedid your mom saw that cardyeah she was dying😂😂😂she was like i̇ was wondering about that too he has a point i̇ am like you both are terriblehahaha you know that's true i agree 😂😂 eveee have you ever come across a situation where you had to convert python code into roops i just saw your message not reallyok no issuesthis is so crazy what people can do with this things so excitingbtw how are you and your brotheri am good my brother is scheduled for tomorrow for surgeryhe found another good doctor so they rescheduled it with bonn him **goodthey will do bone graftok i understand it somewhatthey take bone marrow and make it like a powder i think and put it onlike a concreteno they make this bone powder thing and put it on the fracture and use rods too and it speeds up the process i think like a glueohh okthey found this doctor who operates on famous people and sport people hopefully everything will be fineyes for surebtw i went to vermont the other day so you want to see picsyes please when did you goit was cloudy so not so nice <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted> <media omitted>is it a national park or just random placesjust randomly driving the scenic rroodthat's really nice just cruising aroundyeah from morning to night it's cloudy but it was more colorful than it looks in the picturesyes i have seen pics i need to go there btw that top of the mountain which location is thatso i'll send you a map piccool<media omitted> so this is the map of vermont the green line is the places i drove that high mountain place was <media omitted>wow when did this all happenyesterdaygreatit's so beautifuli thought you were working hahavermont is just so picturesque i took the day off i am leaving anywayshmmm that's a great way to do itwent in the morning and then couple of hours later i left i worked maybe 3 hours it was very random so didn't really plan anythingohh yeah you work in lawrence so it's closer from there best trips are made without planningyeah two women from the team and fernando came with me toohaha that's even more funthey are like this girl is crazyhahaha they haven't seen the real you for sure when your crazy level is 9999yeah i am i feel like going to somewhere and see leaves and stuff we were just talking and he says go to vermont i was like ok you guys want to comeand you just leave for it 🚗🚗🚗i gues they wanted to get away toodoesn't everyoneyeah i know but vermont has a different feel than rest of mass it's more european i guesohh nice i need to go there soonyeah definitely just to drive around and alli love travellingtraveling is the best thing in the worldyes it is thats the reason why i go around boston so muchyeah you actually know boston than i̇ am hahahahaha true that you covered the lower central part of vermont right just saw the maps the best thing is it doesn't take much time to drive the distances you carry on i will bother you lateryeah the lower part it was a day thing you can cover more maybe but it would be rushed i think the only white part is vermont the bottom is massyeah but that vermont part in the map is just lower left part the lower right part is not displayedyes so whole map is like this <media omitted><media omitted> is it very different from new hamshirethey are side by sideno i mean in terms of fall foilagenew hampshire i went to the mountain directly so it should be about the same temperature but i heard vermont is at peakgreat ttylok honey latereveee is it fine if i email you the links of important stuff i find of data science because just bookmarking doesn't classify them as i need itu can delete it if you don't want itbtw i had sent you the syllabus you requestedyeah i saw thankshow do you still deal with all the shit i put upit doesn't bother methat's why you are eveee eveee a quick questionere are some questions that i need to answer that's fine but i had a question is it fine to attach my updated resume in the email and stating " hereby i have also attached my updated resume just in case it's needed"should i do thatyou can it doesn't hurtokay eveee my math genius i have a issue i am facing in one of the assignment it's a probability problem p(d | s1 s2)]-> what is the probability of d when s1 and s2 have occured whats the formula for that or how do i derive itsorry i just saw the message have crazy phone schedule because of my brother look at conditional probability formula that's conditional probability has a formulathat's totally fine i understand ithe is good will stay in the hospital till mo dayok<media omitted> got ticket sahhhh wow great eveee btw i was gonna msg you now about the probability problem i got the formula for p(a|b) but for p(a| bc) is nowhere to be foundfound this p(a|bc) = p(b)* p(ab|c)even the last term is unknown i like maths but hate probabilitywhat class is this forthe simpler one 😜 nevermind i will figure something outoh ok when do you needi have time till wednesdaysend me the whole thing on my email i ll look when i am homeokno i ll take a look but i am working right now send me the whole problemyeah i knowdn't want to bother you muchsure i will sendit's not too busygood hen then today i successfully trained a image dataset on my graphic card rather than the cpu it was way faster and got accuracy of 74% which is somewhat goodgood do you do r for thatpythondo u use r for the other classyesr deep learning you can use r but it's just that 90% of the people use python<media omitted>that's so true hahahyeah hey eveeei am looking at it nowsorry eveee i am bothering you so much when so many things are going on in your lifeno honey it's fine is there any way to calculate p(s1s2)i have no idea i did this based on the formula i had for just one symptomyou can make s1s2 equal to something else and apply conditional formulaits okwill ask himyou know what the difficult class doesn't have a ta because of low class strengthi was thinking something like this <media omitted> can the computer program give the answer so you know if you are doing correctly numerical i meanit can if we give it the correct input if i assign a value to s1^s2 then i should be able to use the above formulai think you can also divide the p(s1s2|d) from other formulasdivide or deriveyeah derive make it smaller whateveryeah that's what i was trying to figure out so i came up with this but i am not sure whether it's correct <media omitted>it may be something like that equals to p(s1|d)*p(s2|d)i did the same thinghow did you get rid of p(s1s2) on the bottoms m how did you come up with that formulawhat i did is i calculated p(s1) and then p(s2) then used the formula to calculate p(d |s) and modified it to p(d | s1s2) you can see it in the word file i sent youcan you do that when there is 2 conditionshaha that's what i assumedwhy multiplication not addition theni am not sure whether we can use it like that i thought of addition but then the probability was somewhat too high to have the diseasehahaha like your thinkinghaha nevermindok let me know too i am curioussure eveee you carry on😂when do you have classeswednesday and fridayhim ok i ll think of something maybe after i leave in one of the days during the week till what time that thing is open5 i think or 6 in weekendsok not this week maybe next week sometimeor maybe in november start coz i might have midterms coming after midterms it will be chilled out so seems good to meoh ok that works toocool thenyou can use it for a year the ticketsohh that's cool ohh yeah i saw nowyeah i know😂 eveee you were right we have to somehow calculate p(s1s2) so i have to come up with some random % for whats the probability of symptom 1 being present when you have symptom 2 and vice versa so the ta just provided me with this stuff: p(d | s1s2) = p(ds1 | s1s2) so i have to calculate the other values i will send you my updated doc when its donecool send me lateryeah eeeeeevvvvvvvveeeeeeeee how is everything going on dearhappy diwali :)thank you so much guess whatbad ones3 chinese😂😂😂why you laughing 😪that would be me i would always get the bad ones that's why i am laughinghahaha even i was bad rightno you were the best one i hadlol seriouslyyou are the only team mate i kept in touch this longohh i feel flatteredi wish we work togetherhahahathat i do all the workbut i do feel the same i wish you were in ads and cognitive classno i think we are a good team that's difficult to findyeahaww thank youawwwwww hahait was ok did you figure out you assignmentyeah but then again there is a deadlock so they extended it till tomorrow see this <media omitted> <media omitted> p(ds1 | s1s2) = p(s1s2|ds1) * p(ds1) / p(s1s2) to find p(s1s2|ds1) i need p(ds1 | s1s2) and vice versa even others are stuck if you ask the ta he is like then whats the point of the assignment lolso you solved it i didn't get itno i didn'tat answer is just the solution of last two termthe value of the first term is still unknownoh that's complicatedyeah eeeeveeeee guess what is today underwear run hahaha <media omitted>your favorite activity 😂😂😂t reallyi didn't participateit's ok mitesh i won't tell anyonehahaomg you crazyi didn't do itmaybe you did who knowsi don't find any reason to hide anything from youomg we should do it together are you doing it in phytonyou wanna do it we are doing it in r we can also do it in pythonwhy
